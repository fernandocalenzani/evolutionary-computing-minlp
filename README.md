# PESDEE_MINLP - Evolutionary Computing for Electric Energy Distribution Systems

This repository presents an innovative adaptation in the methodology for the technical planning of electric energy distribution systems. The primary objective is to incorporate stochastic profiles of generation and consumption of electric energy into the planning process. Through this study, the loading on the buses was accurately calculated, addressing all relevant magnitudes associated with the problem. The methodology allows for the estimation and replacement of conductors with loading exceeding 66%.

## Key Methodologies and Resources
- **OPENDSS Integration:** Utilizes resources provided by OPENDSS for calculating IEEE123 and MATLAB network power flow.
- **Data Management:** Implements effective data management techniques for handling diverse aspects of the network, including noise filtering and manipulation.
- **Cost Estimation:** Calculates the cost associated with repowering the entire network following simulations of efficiency flow and permutations of generation and consumption points.
